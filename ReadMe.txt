# **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis**

## **Dataset Overview**  
This dataset contains transaction records for an online UK-based retail company operating between **December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011**. The business is registered in the UK and operates as a non-store retailer, meaning sales are conducted online.  

Many of the company's customers are **wholesalers (B2B)**, leading to potentially large bulk purchases. The dataset consists of approximately **500,000+ transactions**, providing valuable insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and revenue generation.

## **Dataset Attributes**  
The dataset includes the following attributes:  

| **Column Name**  | **Description**  | **Data Type**  |  
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|  
| **InvoiceNo**  | Unique invoice number for each transaction (6-digit). If it starts with ‘C’, it indicates a cancellation. | *Nominal (Categorical)* |  
| **StockCode**  | Unique product (item) identifier (5-digit). | *Nominal (Categorical)* |  
| **Description**  | Name or description of the product/item. | *Nominal (Categorical)* |  
| **Quantity**  | Number of units purchased per transaction. | *Numeric* |  
| **InvoiceDate**  | Date and time when the transaction was recorded. | *Datetime (Numeric)* |  
| **UnitPrice**  | Price per unit of the product in sterling (£). | *Numeric (Float)* |  
| **CustomerID**  | Unique customer identifier (5-digit). | *Nominal (Categorical)* |  
| **Country**  | Name of the country where the customer is based. | *Nominal (Categorical)* |

## **Objective of the CLV Analysis**  
The goal of this analysis is to calculate **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** by analyzing customer transactions over time. CLV helps in:  

- **Understanding long-term revenue potential** of each customer.  
- **Segmenting customers** based on their purchasing behavior.  
- **Predicting future revenue** and customer retention trends.  
- **Optimizing marketing strategies** by identifying high-value customers.  

---

## **Potential Data Processing & Analysis Steps**  
### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing or null values (especially in `CustomerID`).  
- Removing canceled transactions (`InvoiceNo` starting with 'C').  
- Filtering out negative or zero `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` values.  

### **2. Feature Engineering**  
- Calculating **Total Revenue** per transaction:  
  ```python
  TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice
### **3. Feature Engineering**
- **Extracting transaction frequency per customer.**  
- **Determining recency**, i.e., how recently a customer made a purchase.  
- **Segmenting customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.**  

---

### **4. CLV Estimation Methods**  
- **Historical CLV:** Using past transaction data to estimate CLV.  
- **Predictive CLV:** Applying probabilistic models (e.g., BG/NBD model, Gamma-Gamma model).  
- **Machine Learning-Based CLV:** Using regression models or deep learning for CLV predictions.  

---

### **5. Customer Segmentation & Insights**  
- **Identifying high-value customers** for targeted retention strategies.  
- **Finding patterns in low-value or churn-prone customers.**  
- **Analyzing CLV trends across different countries.**  

---

## **Usage & Implementation**  
The analysis will be implemented using **Python** and common data science libraries, such as:  

- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models for CLV prediction  
- **Lifetimes Library** – BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models for CLV estimation  

---

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- A **CLV model** that predicts customer value over time.  
- A **dashboard or report** with customer insights and segmentation.  
- **Recommendations for business strategy & marketing optimization.**
